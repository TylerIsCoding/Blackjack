<p>This is a game that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and the OOP paradigm.</p>

<h2>How It's Made</h2>
<p><strong>Tech Used:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</p>
<br>
<p>
I built this game with mainly JavaScript. I wanted to test my skills with OOP and create a card game from scratch.

- HTML5 provided the structure and content for the website
- CSS3 was used to style and layout the website
- JavaScript was used to create the entirety of the game's code, AI, and some visuals.
</p>
<br>
<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Here are some ways that I could increase performance on the game:

I could have:

- I did not know the deckofcards API even existed when I built this.
- I did not know how to use an API when I started this project.
- Fixed a few bugs that remain and it's not 100% responsive.

</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>Building this game was a great learning experience and I took away several valuable lessons:

- I created every part of this game, including the deck object, it's methods, and the AI.
- I could have used the deckofcards API and made my job a lot easier. I might revisit this project at some point in the future.
- This was when I was first learning OOP and it really made me appreciate not writing this with just functions.
